      <h1>About the Species</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
      <p>
        The Hawaiian monk seal is one of the most endangered seal species in the
        world. These seals are <b>endemic</b> to the Hawaiian Archipelago, which
        means that they only live here, and nowhere else in the world. Hawaiian
        monk seals are protected under the federal
        <span style="color: #347ab7; font-weight: bold"
          >Endangered Species Act</span
        >, the
        <span style="color: #347ab7; font-weight: bold"
          >Marine Mammal Protection Act</span
        >, and Hawaii State law.
      </p>
      <p>
        After nearly being wiped out by exploitation and disturbance in the
        1800s,the Hawaiian monk seal population rebounded slightly, only to
        decline again steeply in the late 1950s. This trend continued into the
        last decade, with the current population numbers at only about one-third
        of historic population levels: around 1,400 seals in total— with about
        ~1,100 seals in the remote Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) and only
        about ~300 seals spread throughout the main Hawaiian Islands (MHI).
        Thanks to the conservation and
        <span style="color: #347ab7; font-weight: bold">recovery efforts</span>
        of NOAA and their partners, decades of decline have been slowly
        reversing, and the population has been growing at an average rate of
        about 2 percent per year since 2013. This is great news! However, it is
        only the beginning of a long road to population recovery, and the
        Hawaiian monk seals still need your help.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Hawaiian monk seal is one of NOAA Fisheries'

        and raise awareness of ongoing conservation efforts.

      <h1>Appearance</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
      <p>
        Newborn monk seal pups are born all black, but they typically shed this
        black coat prior to weaning. Weaned pups and older seals are dark gray
        to brown on their back and light gray to yellowish brown on their belly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some seals are born with “natural bleach” marks, or small areas of skin
        and fur that lack pigment. Sort of like a birthmark, these natural
        bleaches are unique and can be used to help identify which seal you are
        looking at.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s a big scary ocean, and it can be a hard life out there for a seal.
        As seals age, they collect scars from a variety of injuries: large shark
        bites, cookie cutter shark bites, entanglements, boat interactions, etc.
        If the scars are deep enough to last through their annual molt, and are
        unique enough in shape and location, then they can also be used to help
        identify a seal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monk seals undergo a "catastrophic molt" about once per year, where they
        shed the entire top layer of their skin and all of their fur. If you
        aren’t expecting it, sometimes it can look like the seal is in distress
        or has been injured, best rest assured they are just fine although the
        process can be very itchy and uncomfortable, and the seals can be a
        little extra sensitive and grumpy during this time. So while molting is
        a normal part of life for a seal, it’s best to give them extra space.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monk seals with a bright and silvery coat have just molted. Their fresh
        new skin and fur is extra shiny, but the molting process can take a lot
        out of a seal. They might need to go foraging for some fishy snacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is that a green seal? Seals that have spent a long time foraging at sea
        can grow algae on their fur. This is common around the eyes, mouth,
        flippers, and belly. And “being green” is especially common in juvenile
        seals; it can sometimes look like they are wearing a green mask. Seals
        that look green haven't molted recently and may be getting ready to shed
        into a new silvery coat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Male and female monk seals are very similar in size and shape. You can
        distinguish males from females by looking at their belly. Both male and
        female seals have a 5 point mark on their bellies: the teats are 4
        points forming a square, with the 5th point being the umbilicus (belly
        button) in the center of that square. In males, the penile groove is
        posterior to the umbilicus, and extends forward in a ridge from the
        pelvis.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="infoTitle">
      <h1>Behavior & Diet</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
      <p>
        Monk seals spend two-thirds of their time foraging at sea and use coral
        beds as foraging habitat. Hawaiian monk seals are "generalist" feeders,
        which means they eat a wide variety of foods depending on what's
        available. They eat many types of common fishes, squids, octopuses,
        eels, and crustaceans (crabs, shrimps, and lobsters). They tend not to
        target most of the popular gamefish species, such as ulua (giant
        trevally), pāpio (baby ulua), or the ‘ō‘io (bonefish). Instead, they
        usually prefer to target prey that hides in the sand, under rocks, and
        in pockets in the coral.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monk seals haul-out on land to rest, molt, give birth, and nurse their
        pups on the sand, corals, and volcanic rock shorelines. They prefer
        sandy, protected beaches surrounded by shallow waters for pupping. Seals
        may look like they are just being lazy on the beach, but often they are
        recovering from long, multi-day, open ocean swims to far-off reefs or
        between islands. They need their rest to recuperate, so please respect
        their distance and adhere to the Seal Resting Area closures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hawaiian monk seals can hold their breath for up to 20 minutes, and dive
        more than 1,800 feet below the surface. However, they usually don’t show
        off quite so much: the average dive for a monk seal is about 6 minutes
        long and to depths of less than 200 feet, where they forage on the
        seafloor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hawaiian monk seals are mostly solitary and don't live in colonies like
        other seals. Monk seals appreciate their personal space, but they do
        sometimes lie near each other in pairs or small groups, and males will
        sometimes try to “attend" a female by laying near her while she rests.
        They usually sleep on beaches, sometimes for days at a time and also
        occasionally sleep in tidepools and small underwater caves.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hawaiian monk seals do not migrate seasonally, but can travel hundreds
        of miles in the open ocean. Individual seals often frequent the same
        beaches over and over, but they do not defend territories.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="infoTitle">
      <h1>Lifespan & Reproduction</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="info">
      <p>
        Monk seals can live to over 30 years of age, but few actually live that
        long. Unfortunately, survival rates can be very low for juvenile seals
        (under 4 years old). It is a hard life out there for a little seal. But
        survival rates do get better once the seals mature; they grow, they
        learn how to successfully forage, avoid many dangerous situations, and
        get big enough to look less tasty to other marine predators. The average
        lifespan for an adult Hawaiian monk seal is around ~25 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monk seals mate at sea, and the event is rarely witnessed. The youngest
        documented female to give birth was 4 years old, but typically females
        in the main Hawaiian Islands begin reproducing at about 5 to 6 years
        old. Monk seals don’t usually begin reproducing until about 7 to 10
        years old in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, where resources can be
        more scarce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monk seal females typically give birth to pups on sandy, protected
        beaches surrounded by shallow waters. Mothers and pups will remain on
        this natal beach for about 6 weeks. The majority of that time will be
        spent nursing, growing, and resting, but there will also be some play
        and swimming lessons in later weeks as the pups get bigger and stronger.
        Mothers want to make sure that their pups get as big and fat as she can
        make them before weaning, transferring up to one-third of their body
        weight to the pup in six weeks. But mothers do not leave their pups to
        find food, so after nursing for so long, they are emaciated and must go
        back to sea to forage. Mothers leave their pups abruptly, occasionally
        returning once or twice within the first few hours, and the pup will be
        weaned. Weaned pups will remain near their natal beach, exploring,
        learning, and living off the fat their mothers gave them, until they too
        feel the need to go further out for food.
